* Probably remove CustomerFolder, Customer and ProjectMember from UML
  model.

* Check and double-check newly generated code in directory Extensions
  with old dumped code in directory workflow.


Branch specific TODOS:

* Tasks should have an optional deadline

* Permission for Assigning Tasks:
  ATM this is bound to the role Employee.
  - assignable roles shall be defined in the XMTool
  - refactor Task._get_assignees to search for users with roles
    set in XMTool

* Project.getMembers:
  Should work for pas and gruf setup.
  Write testcases for both setups

* Task._get_assignees:
  This method should work for users defined in arbitrary userfolders
  up the aquisition hierarchy.
  Write a testcase and refactor method if necessary.
