======================
 Overview of portlets
======================


There are quite some portlets and, historically, their names aren't always
obvious or helpful. So here's a full list.

- **Personal administration**. File ``portlet_tasks.py``. Links to task
    overview, detailed bookins, bookings per month, time registration and so.

- **Iterations**. File ``iterations.py``. List of iterations per state.

- **Project links**. File ``project.py``. List of your own projects.

- **Project management**. File ``managers.py``. Links to employee, invoicing
    and in-progress overviews and to the project administration.


Existing old-style portlets
---------------------------

There are still old-style portlets in skins/eXtremeManagement. They'll be
moved to new-style portlets.

- **portlet_my_projects.pt**. List of my projects. Looks to be a
    semi-duplicate of "project links".

- **portlet_poi.pt**. A form for mass-creating poi tasks out of poi issues and
    a provider of a link back to the poi task when looking at the related
    issue and a way to create a task for this issue in an open story.

- **portlet_stories.pt**. List of to-be-estimated stories.
