  - content/story.py
    getRawEstimate was accessing tasks by calling contentValues()
    we also want to allow other content apart from tasks in
    stories so i refactored the code in story
    to use the new method getStoryTasks that is aware of that.
    
  - skins/getStateSortedContent.py
    set the filter on Story and Task objects, to make a story
    containing other types than tasks beeing displayable.
    since the script is also used in a project to display stories
    i added  story as a type too.

  - tools/xmtool.py:
    added filtering capability to ``getFilteredIssues``
  
  - skins/xm_dashboard.pt
    refactored dashboard using a script rather than the tools-method
    to be able to call it anywhere in the portal and get all issues
    and tasks in the current path.
    dashboard only shows todo issues/tasks ('open', 'in-progress', ...)
