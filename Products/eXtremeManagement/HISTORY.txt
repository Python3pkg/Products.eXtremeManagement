  * Merge the mergeable parts of branches/1.2-events:

  - 38656:40204: small start with event handler, big cleanup of tests,
    add testbrowser tests, use IntDisplayList for Task/Booking
    hours/minutes.

  - 40226: only the part of this commit that changes doc/create.txt
    and tests dir: manually fire event.

  - 40256: use e.g. tasks.update(hours=5) instead of other ways to
    update fields, which helps in triggering a reindex.

  - 40417: add property sheet for eXtremeManagement with GenericSetup,
    containing HOURS_PER_DAY and MAXIMUM_NOT_COMPLETED_PERCENTAGE that
    used to be in AppConfig.py

  - 41415:41483: improve the order of the install function and the
    GenericSetup steps, moving functions from that quick installer to
    GS.  Add property send_task_mails to our property sheet, which can
    be set to False when updating the Task schema (which is done
    during install).

  - content/story.py
    getRawEstimate was accessing tasks by calling contentValues()
    we also want to allow other content apart from tasks in
    stories so i refactored the code in story
    to use the new method getStoryTasks that is aware of that.
    
  - skins/getStateSortedContent.py
    set the filter on Story and Task objects, to make a story
    containing other types than tasks beeing displayable.
    since the script is also used in a project to display stories
    i added  story as a type too.

  - tools/xmtool.py:
    added filtering capability to ``getFilteredIssues``
  
  - skins/xm_dashboard.pt
    refactored dashboard using a script rather than the tools-method
    to be able to call it anywhere in the portal and get all issues
    and tasks in the current path.
    dashboard only shows todo issues/tasks ('open', 'in-progress', ...)
