Installation
============

  Just install eXtremeManagement like you would any other Plone
  product: put it in its own directory within the Products dir of your
  zope instance.

  If you use instancemanager
  (http://plone.org/products/instance-manager), then see:
  https://svn.zestsoftware.nl/svn/zest/eXtremeManagement/integration/trunk/instancemanager.py


Dependencies
============

  * Plone 2.1 series with Zope 2.8 OR

  * Plone 2.5 series with Zope 2.9

  It might work with other versions, but we don't test that.


Recommended Products
====================

  * Poi bundle; at Zest Software we are using

  http://plone.org/products/poi/releases/1.0/poi-1-0rc2pre1-bundle-tar.gz

  If you install Poi, eXtremeManagement will allow you to add an issue
  tracker in a project.  Also there is a page xm_dashboard that lists
  Poi issues.  Expect more integration in the future.  We hope to be
  flexible enough to make integration with other issue trackers
  (e.g. trac) possible.  But the current eXtremeManagement developers
  like Poi. :)


Additional dependencies for development
=======================================

 * PloneTestCase:
   https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTestCase/trunk/ or the
   latest tar.gz (install as a product).  Make sure that all tests run
   before you check in changes.

 * DocFinderTab is recommended:
   http://plone.org/products/DocfinderTab


Possible problem: old totals for Tasks
======================================

There are several views that give you an overview of Tasks and how
much has been booked on them.  This used to take quite long to compute
as you would need to go in the Zope database and wake up all the
Booking objects for all those tasks.  So some optimizations were done
so Tasks get their info out of the catalog, which is much faster.
This makes part of the code a bit hacky as the total for that task
needs to be correct also after moving or deleting a Booking.  It seems
to go fine now though and there are tests for this.  If you see any
errors, please report them.

At least in one case it goes wrong at the moment.  When you go to the
portal_catalog in the Zope Management Interface and perform for
instance a Clear and Rebuild, you'll get wrong totals for Tasks.  This
happens because at the moment the Task gets catalogued, none of its
Bookings are in the catalog, so its total will be zero hours.  The
solution is to recatalog the Tasks after the Clear and Rebuild is
finished.

In every other case that you find for a single task, the totals should
be fine again after the task is reindexed, which can be forced e.g. by
editing it or performing a workflow transition, or adding or editing a
Booking in that Task.

Anyway, this should work a lot cleaner with Zope 3 events, but those
are not available in Zope 2.8, which we still want to support.


Skins
=====

   Just so you know: eXtremeManagement by default installs its own
   skin.


Migration from before release 1.0
=================================

 * If you have been using the subversion trunk from before the first
   official release, then you may have a migration issue.  The
   workflow for Tasks has been simplified, which means some old states
   now don't exist anymore.  Upon reinstall the migration code will
   take care of this.  Assigned and estimated tasks are set to the
   open state.  In-progress tasks normally get the to-do status.  In a
   few cases this may not work.  When that in-progress task doesn't
   have an estimate (or rather: it is 0) or it doesn't have any
   assignees, then it will go to the open state instead.  If you don't
   like that, you can fix those tasks by hand either before or after
   the migration.  The reinstall will leave a url and explanation for
   each offending task in the install log.

Conflicting Products
====================

  * eXtremeManagement is known not to work with ZEPP, another project
  management product.  It uses a Task content type, just like
  eXtremeManagement does.  This causes problems.  If you want to try
  out both, do that in separate Zope instances.
