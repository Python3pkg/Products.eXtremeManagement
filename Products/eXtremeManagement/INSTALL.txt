Installation
============

  Just install eXtremeManagement like you would any other Plone
  product: put it in its own directory within the Products dir of your
  zope instance.

  If you use instancemanager
  (http://plone.org/products/instance-manager), then see:
  https://svn.zestsoftware.nl/svn/zest/eXtremeManagement/integration/trunk/instancemanager.py


Dependencies
============

  * Plone 2.1 series with Zope 2.8 OR

  * Plone 2.5 series with Zope 2.9

  It might work with other versions, but we don't test that.


Recommended Products
====================

  * Poi bundle; at Zest Software we are using

  http://plone.org/products/poi/releases/1.0/poi-1-0rc2pre1-bundle-tar.gz

  If you install Poi, eXtremeManagement will allow you to add an issue
  tracker in a project.  Also there is a page xm_dashboard that lists
  Poi issues.  Expect more integration in the future.  We hope to be
  flexible enough to make integration with other issue trackers
  (e.g. trac) possible.  But the current eXtremeManagement developers
  like Poi. :)


Additional dependencies for development
=======================================

 * PloneTestCase:
   https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTestCase/trunk/ or the
   latest tar.gz (install as a product).  Make sure that all tests run
   before you check in changes.

 * DocFinderTab is recommended:
   http://plone.org/products/DocfinderTab


Skins
=====

   Just so you know: eXtremeManagement by default installs its own
   skin.


Migration from before release 1.0
=================================

 * If you have been using the subversion trunk from before the first
   official release, then you may have a migration issue.  The
   workflow for Tasks has been simplified, which means some old states
   now don't exist anymore.  Upon reinstall the migration code will
   take care of this.  Assigned and estimated tasks are set to the
   open state.  In-progress tasks normally get the to-do status.  In a
   few cases this may not work.  When that in-progress task doesn't
   have an estimate (or rather: it is 0) or it doesn't have any
   assignees, then it will go to the open state instead.  If you don't
   like that, you can fix those tasks by hand either before or after
   the migration.  The reinstall will leave a url and explanation for
   each offending task in the install log.

Conflicting Products
====================

  * eXtremeManagement is known not to work with ZEPP, another project
  management product.  It uses a Task content type, just like
  eXtremeManagement does.  This causes problems.  If you want to try
  out both, do that in separate Zope instances.
