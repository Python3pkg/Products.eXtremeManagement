Installation
============

  Just install eXtremeManagement like you would any other Plone
  product: put it in its own directory within the Products dir of your
  zope instance.

  If you use instancemanager
  (http://plone.org/products/instance-manager), then see:
  https://svn.zestsoftware.nl/svn/zest/eXtremeManagement/integration/trunk/instancemanager.py


Dependencies
============

  * Plone 2.1 series with Zope 2.8 or 2.9 OR

  * Plone 2.5 series with Zope 2.9


Recommended Products
====================

  * Poi bundle; at Zest Software we are using

  http://plone.org/products/poi/releases/1.0/poi-1-0rc2pre1-bundle-tar.gz

  If you install Poi, eXtremeManagement will allow you to add an issue
  tracker in a project.  Also there is a page xm_dashboard that lists
  Poi issues.  Expect more integration in the future.  We hope to be
  flexible enough to make integration with other issue trackers
  (e.g. trac) possible.  But the current eXtremeManagement developers
  like Poi. :)


Additional dependencies for development
=======================================

 * PloneTestCase:
   https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/PloneTestCase/trunk/ or the
   latest tar.gz (install as a product).  Make sure that all tests run
   before you check in changes.

 * DocFinderTab is recommended:
   http://plone.org/products/DocfinderTab


Possible problem: old totals for Tasks
======================================

There are several views that give you an overview of Tasks and how
much has been booked on them.  This used to take quite long to compute
as you would need to go in the Zope database and wake up all the
Booking objects for all those tasks.  So some optimizations were done
so Tasks get their info out of the catalog, which is much faster.

In one case it goes wrong at the moment.  When you go to the
portal_catalog in the Zope Management Interface and perform for
instance a Clear and Rebuild, you'll get wrong totals for Tasks.  This
happens because at the moment the Task gets catalogued, none of its
Bookings are in the catalog, so its total will be zero hours.  The
solution is to recatalog the Tasks after the Clear and Rebuild is
finished.


Skins
=====

eXtremeManagement by default installs its own skin next to Plone
Default and Tableless.  We plan to get rid of that in the future.


Conflicting Products
====================

  * eXtremeManagement is known not to work with ZEPP, another project
  management product.  It uses a Task content type, just like
  eXtremeManagement does.  This causes problems.  If you want to try
  out both, do that in separate Zope instances.

  * Same is true for PloneBooking.
